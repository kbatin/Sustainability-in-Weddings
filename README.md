# Are Sustainable Wedding Vendors More Affordable? An Analytical Approach (December 2023)

This project addresses a key business question: *Are wedding vendors with sustainable practices more cost-effective?* Using SQL and Python, the analysis dives into vendor data to uncover potential cost advantages of sustainability in the wedding industry.

### Project Highlights:
- **Data Exploration with SQL:** SQL queries are used to explore and categorize wedding vendors based on their sustainability practices and costs. Temporary tables are created to facilitate analysis, and the final dataset is prepared for Python by grouping vendors into relevant categories based on size and budget levels.
- **Statistical Analysis with Python:** Once the dataset is imported into Python, descriptive statistics, frequency tables, and correlations are computed to determine if thereâ€™s a statistically significant cost advantage for sustainable vendors. The analysis goes beyond basic metrics, providing actionable insights for decision-makers.
- **Visualizations:** A set of visualizations, including scatterplots and boxplots, helps illustrate trends and correlations between vendor sustainability and costs. These visuals are carefully designed to support the analysis and actionable recommendations.
- **Actionable Insights:** The project concludes with two key insights, each supported by credible sources and statistical evidence. These insights provide strategic recommendations on how wedding planners and event coordinators can leverage sustainable vendors while considering cost implications.

This project not only answers the central business question but also demonstrates the ability to manage and analyze data effectively using SQL and Python, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the wedding industry.
